# IB-HL-Computer-Science-Internal-Assessment
My project files from my IB CS IA.

The project is called Dexterity Test and is essentially a remake of the Human Benchmark Test website. Remaking the games from the website, but in Godot.
Godot has a built in programming language, GDScript, that I used, which is very similar to Python.

The .gd files that end in test, e.x. sequencememorytest.gd, is the actual test with the actual functionality. The .gd files with just the name of the test, e.x. sequencememory.gd is just the scene before the actual test and is where the user would choose to start the test, and it displays a brief description of the test.

The CS IA Documentation is the required documentation by the IB.
