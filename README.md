# IB-HL-Computer-Science-Internal-Assessment
My project files from my IB CS IA.

The project is called Dexterity Test and is essentially a remake of the Human Benchmark Test website. Remaking the games on the website, but in Godot.
Godot has a built in programming language, GDScript, that I used, which is very similar to Python.
